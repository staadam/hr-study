#Study Buddy ğŸ“š

Web app created during React course. <br/>
Its purpose is to manage students grades, fetching news and store notes. <br/>
All students data are randomly generated using [faker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker) and stored in mocked db. <br/>
You can view students by group or search them by name in searchbar. <br/>
News are fetched from DatoCMS using Axios and GraphQL.<br/>
Created with RWD in mind.
